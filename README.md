# Track Work Hours

### Overview
Build a web application to track work hours for freelancers and independent professionals. Users should be able to record tasks, track time spent, manage payments, and generate invoices. The application will communicate with an external REST API backend.

### Tech Stack
- Framework: Angular (Standalone components, no NgModules)
- UI Library: PrimeNG
- Backend Communication: RESTful HTTP services
- Architecture and Code Quality: Follow SOLID principles strictly

### Deliverables
- Complete frontend layout and basic HTTP service scaffolding.
- Dockerfile configured with a multistage build.
- Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions.
- Standardized .gitignore file.
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Key Features
- Secure backend communication using JWT authentication tokens.
- Task registration functionality.

Requirements
- The application must build and run successfully without errors or warnings.
- Clearly structured code, adhering strictly to best practices and clean architecture guidelines.
- The resulting application should clearly demonstrate:
    - JWT integration for secured backend requests.
    - Capability to register new tasks (UI and HTTP service ready for integration).
